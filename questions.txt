What is the default population size? Does it ever change during the simulation?

How many generations did it take until you got a maximally fit flower?

What methods does the Flower class have? How many "traits" does a flower have?

What fraction of the population is allowed to mate each year?

In this simulation, are flowers allowed to mate with themselves? How would you 
change this?

How does a flower's fitness affect its ability to mate? Does a higher fitness 
make a difference amongst those selected as the "most fit" in a generation?

How would you change the code to make the survival selection more severe? What 
impact might this have?

How would you change the code to make mutations more frequent? What impact 
might this have?

If the population size were very small, (less than 10), what kinds of results
might you expect?

What features of this process are essential to allowing the population to 
increase in fitness?

Modify the code to print average fitness for each generation.

Modify the code so that the starting population is smaller than the maximum.
